There are many [[programming languages]] that can be used to create an operating system.
- They need to have direct access to memory 
- We will be using [[C]]
- Will use Makefile for contruction
- Virtual machines will be used to debug our OS
	- We will use [[VirtualBox]] 

To compile [[Assembly Code]] we will be using NASM as the assembler
We will be using a [[UNIX]] like operating system as the host OS

We will go to [[BIOS]] -> [[Bootloader]] -> OS
